Hello 

As Part of Problem Set 0 for the CS course we've asked to create a simple program that follows the following conditions

- Two sprites minimum 
- Three scripts minimum 
- One conditional
- One loop
- One Variable
- One custom block
- Be comparable to some examples provided by the course 

This is my fist game made with scratch, although I know a little bit of programing due to my background I'm not that familiar with pure coding, however the program designed for this problem set should meet these requirements without any issue.

Hope you like it.
